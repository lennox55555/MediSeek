    },
    {
      "question": "Why do public health guidelines often fail to motivate people to exercise?",
      "answer": "Public health guidelines often fail to motivate people because they are not inherently motivational and can create a mindset that makes people feel worse about themselves. Simply telling people to exercise because it's good for them does not change behavior.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "exercise motivation, public health"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do perceptions of exercise relative to others affect health outcomes?",

    {
      "question": "What is a stress mindset and how can it be reprogrammed to be more beneficial?",
      "answer": "A stress mindset refers to how we perceive and think about stress. It can be reprogrammed by consciously bringing stress mindsets to our awareness and considering stress as enhancing rather than debilitating. This involves acknowledging stress, welcoming it as a sign of caring about something, and utilizing the stress response to achieve goals.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "stress mindset, mental health"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can stress be leveraged to improve performance rather than simply managed?",
      "answer": "Instead of merely managing stress through activities like vacations or massages, stress can be leveraged by adopting a mindset that sees stress as a neutral effect linked to goal-related efforts.

    },
    {
      "question": "How can parents help their children develop positive mindsets about food and stress?",
      "answer": "Parents can help by focusing on instilling adaptive mindsets rather than enforcing behaviors. For example, they can promote the idea that healthy foods are indulgent and delicious, and that stress is a natural part of life that can lead to growth and learning, rather than something to be avoided.",
