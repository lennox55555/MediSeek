      "question": "What are adaptogens and how do they function?",
      "answer": "Adaptogens are compounds, often supplements or drugs, that help buffer stress. They can be found in food, supplements, or behaviors and work by reducing reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": [
        "adaptogens",
        "stress management"
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "Why has the focus shifted from antioxidants to inflammatory responses in recent years?",
      "answer": "The focus has shifted because while reactive oxygen species are a major source of cellular stress, inflammatory responses and cytokines are also significant contributors to cellular stress.",

      "topic": [
        "antioxidants",
        "inflammation"

    {
      "question": "What is the recommended way to consume dark leafy greens to preserve their adaptogenic properties?",
      "answer": "Dark leafy greens should not be overcooked, as excessive heat can destroy their nutrients. If cooking causes colored fluid to leach out, it is beneficial to consume that fluid as well.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How can calorie intake affect stress levels?",
      "answer": "If you do not ingest enough calories each day, you might be in a mild mode of stress, which can increase cortisol output. It's important to ingest sufficient calories for your goals to avoid unnecessary stress.",
