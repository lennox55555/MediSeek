      "answer": "Processed foods, whether from animal or non-animal sources, tend to create activity within the body that leads to over-consumption of calories and weight gain. This effect is linked to the nervous system and occurs even when weight gain cannot be explained by increased calorie intake alone.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "processed foods, weight gain"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does genetic makeup influence dietary preferences and gut health?",
