    },
    {
      "question": "How does the brain process faces and vocalizations, and why is this important for social bonding?",
      "answer": "The brain processes faces through the fusiform face area, which is responsible for recognizing faces. This recognition is particularly strong between children and their parents. Similarly, parents can accurately recognize their child's vocalizations, such as cries. This ability to process faces and vocalizations is crucial for forming strong social bonds.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of interoception and exteroception in emotional regulation?",
      "answer": "Interoception refers to the awareness of internal bodily states, while exteroception is the focus on external events. Emotional regulation involves balancing these two perceptions. People who are emotionally stable can recognize when their internal state is influenced by external events and adjust accordingly, whereas those who are emotionally labile may struggle with this balance.",

      "question": "What role does leptin play in the onset of puberty?",
      "answer": "Leptin, a peptide hormone produced by body fat, signals the brain when there is enough body fat to trigger puberty. The presence of sufficient leptin levels is one of the primary triggers for the onset of puberty.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do pheromones potentially affect puberty and social interactions?",
      "answer": "Pheromones are chemicals released by one member of a species that affect others. In animals, the Vandenbergh effect shows that the presence of a novel male can trigger puberty in a pre-pubertal female. While human pheromonal effects are debated, there is some evidence suggesting weak effects, such as menstrual cycle synchronization.",

      "topic": "pheromones, puberty"
    },
    {
      "question": "What changes occur in the brain during puberty that affect social and emotional development?",
      "answer": "During puberty, there are significant changes in the brain, including the activation of hormone systems by kisspeptin, which leads to the production of estrogen and testosterone. These changes facilitate the transition from being a generalist to a specialist in skills and contribute to the formation of social and emotional bonds.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "brain changes, puberty"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the transition from generalist to specialist important during adolescence?",
      "answer": "The transition from generalist to specialist during adolescence is crucial because it allows individuals to develop specific skills and abilities. This specialization is driven by hormonal and brain changes during puberty, helping adolescents form social bonds and navigate social structures more effectively.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "adolescence, specialization"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are some key changes in the brain during puberty that affect adolescent behavior?",
      "answer": "During puberty, there's increased connectivity between the prefrontal cortex, dopamine centers, and the amygdala. This integration and testing of circuits for emotions and reward influence adolescents to test social and physical interactions, often leading to risky behavior.",

      "topic": "adolescent brain development, puberty, behavior"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does oxytocin influence social behavior and bonding?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the vagus nerve play in emotional regulation?",

      "topic": "vagus nerve, emotional regulation, neuroscience"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do vasopressin levels affect social and mating behaviors?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why is there a push for later school start times for adolescents?",
