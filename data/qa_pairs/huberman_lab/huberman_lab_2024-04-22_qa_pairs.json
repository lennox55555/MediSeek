      "question": "How does social media influence risky behaviors among adolescents according to the podcast?",
      "answer": "Social media influences risky behaviors by combining marketing with peer pressure, driving youth toward particular risky behaviors. It also allows for the rapid spread of content, which can perpetuate and escalate behaviors among peers.",

      "question": "What is the impact of family structure, such as single-parent or divorced homes, on adolescent risk-taking behavior?",
      "answer": "The literature suggests that it is not the divorce itself but the conflict that creates challenges. If conflict resolves post-divorce, teenagers generally do well. The key factor is parenting quality, including monitoring and involvement in the child's life.",

      "question": "Why might adolescents be attracted to using e-cigarettes, and what role does marketing play?",
      "answer": "Adolescents might be attracted to e-cigarettes due to marketing that targets young people with cool-looking, easy-to-hide devices, flavors that taste like sweets, and appealing names like 'unicorn poop.'

      "question": "Why might high school students be more inclined to start using nicotine products?",
      "answer": "High school students may have missed socialization opportunities in middle school, leading to increased stress.

      "question": "How does salt-based nicotine differ from free-based nicotine in e-cigarettes, and why is it more appealing to teens?",
      "answer": "Salt-based nicotine, which uses benzoic acid, is smoother and less caustic than free-based nicotine, which is more basic and harsh on the throat. This makes salt-based nicotine more appealing to teens who are new to nicotine, as it causes less coughing and discomfort.",

    {
      "question": "What are the potential health risks associated with high levels of nicotine use in adolescents?",
      "answer": "High levels of nicotine use can alter brain chemistry, increasing the likelihood of addiction.

    },
    {
      "question": "How do teens typically fund their e-cigarette habits, and what challenges exist in regulating sales to minors?",
      "answer": "Teens fund their e-cigarette habits through babysitting, using lunch money, or sharing and selling pods among peers. Despite the legal age for purchasing nicotine products being 21, lack of enforcement and easy access online and in stores make it difficult to regulate sales to minors.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What strategies are effective in discouraging teens from using e-cigarettes?",

    {
      "question": "Why is the THC to CBD ratio important when considering cannabis use?",
      "answer": "The THC to CBD ratio is important because high levels of THC, which are more common in modern cannabis, are associated with a higher risk of developing psychosis, especially in individuals predisposed to mental health issues.

      "answer": "Vaping cannabis poses several health risks, including addiction and exposure to harmful chemicals like benzoic acid, which can be absorbed through the skin and lungs. Additionally, high THC levels in cannabis can lead to psychosis, particularly in predisposed individuals, and the rapid absorption of substances through the lungs can quickly affect the brain.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why are teens today less likely to engage in outdoor activities compared to previous generations?",
      "answer": "Teens today are less likely to engage in outdoor activities due to increased use of social media, changes in cultural norms, and parental concerns about safety. These factors have contributed to teens spending more time indoors and on their phones rather than participating in outdoor activities like playing sports or hanging out in parks.",

      "topic": "teen behavior, outdoor activities, social media"
    },
    {
      "question": "How has the availability of rideshare services like Uber and Lyft impacted teen driving habits?",
      "answer": "Rideshare services like Uber and Lyft have led to a decrease in teen driving as they provide a convenient and cost-effective alternative to owning a car. This has also contributed to a reduction in drunk driving incidents among teens, as they can easily access a sober ride home.",

    {
      "question": "How do cultural differences affect the prevalence of e-cigarette use among teenagers in different countries?",
      "answer": "Cultural differences, such as nicotine regulation standards and marketing practices, affect e-cigarette use among teenagers. For example, countries like the UK have lower rates of e-cigarette use due to stricter nicotine content regulations and less aggressive marketing compared to the US. However, recent changes in marketing strategies have led to an increase in use in some countries.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it important to have open conversations with teens about drug use and sexual health?",
      "answer": "Open conversations with teens about drug use and sexual health are crucial because they help provide accurate, science-based information that teens are seeking. Without these discussions, teens may turn to unreliable sources like pornography for sex education or engage in risky behaviors without understanding the consequences. By normalizing these conversations, we can reduce stigma, promote harm reduction, and empower teens to make informed decisions.",

      "topic": "teen education, drug use, sexual health"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can fentanyl test strips and Narcan be used in harm reduction strategies for teens?",
      "answer": "Fentanyl test strips and Narcan can be part of harm reduction strategies by providing teens with tools to test drugs for fentanyl and potentially reverse overdoses. Although not perfect, these tools can help prevent fatal overdoses. The presence of these resources in schools and communities can encourage safer practices among teens who might experiment with drugs.",

    {
      "question": "What are the neurological effects of nicotine on the adolescent brain?",
      "answer": "Nicotine affects the adolescent brain by altering its wiring. Adolescents are born with nicotinic receptors, and introducing nicotine during this developmental period reinforces these receptors, making the brain more susceptible to addiction. This rewiring can lead to a dependency on nicotine, as the brain becomes conditioned to require it to avoid withdrawal symptoms.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What role do teens' personal goals play in preventing risky behaviors?",
      "answer": "Teens' personal goals can play a significant role in preventing risky behaviors by linking their aspirations to their current actions. For example, a teen who wants to become a dancer may set boundaries to avoid pregnancy or substance use that could hinder their future. By connecting their goals with their behaviors, teens can be motivated to make healthier choices.",

    {
      "question": "What are some positive attributes of the adolescent brain that are often overlooked?",
