      "question": "What is the cerebellum and what functions does it serve in the human brain?",
      "answer": "The cerebellum, sometimes referred to as the mini brain, is a structure located at the bottom and back of the human brain. It is responsible for numerous basic functions used in everyday life, including motor behavior such as walking and talking, as well as dancing and playing instruments. It also plays a crucial role in balance, learning new motor behaviors, and our sense of timing.",

      "question": "How do individual differences in sensory perception, such as smell, arise according to Dr. David Linden?",
      "answer": "Individual differences in sensory perception, like smell, arise due to genetic variations in odorant receptors. For example, people have functional differences in about 30% of their odor receptors, leading to varied perceptions of the same smell. Cultural context and learned associations also play a significant role in how odors are perceived.",
