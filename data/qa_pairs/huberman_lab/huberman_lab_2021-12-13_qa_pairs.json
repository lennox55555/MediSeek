      "question": "How does the retina contribute to our visual experience?",
      "answer": "The retina acts like a camera, detecting the initial image and performing initial processing. Ganglion cells in the retina then communicate this information to the brain, where it is processed into a conscious visual experience.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "retina, visual processing"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in circadian rhythms?",

      "topic": "light exposure, melatonin"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do different wavelengths of light affect color perception?",
      "answer": "Different wavelengths of light are detected by three types of cones in the retina, each sensitive to different frequencies. The nervous system compares these signals to create the perception of color.",

      "topic": "ganglion cells, non-visual functions"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does exposure to sunlight affect the development of myopia in children?",
      "answer": "The incidence of myopia, or nearsightedness, is strongly related to the amount of time children spend outdoors. The more time they spend outside, the less likely they are to develop nearsightedness. This could be due to the exposure to bright light, possibly affecting the melanopsin system, or due to the accommodation process where focusing on distant objects outdoors helps prevent myopia.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the thalamus in processing sensory information?",
      "answer": "The thalamus acts as a gateway for sensory information, linking peripheral sensory input like auditory, tactile, and visual signals to the cortex, where it is processed and integrated. It is involved in the major throughput pathway from the retina to the cortex, ending in the visual cortex at the back of the head.",
      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "thalamus, sensory processing"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you explain the concept of visual-vestibular conflict and its relation to motion sickness?",
      "answer": "Visual-vestibular conflict occurs when there is a disagreement between the visual and vestibular systems about motion. For example, when you're looking at a stable image on your phone while in a moving vehicle, your vestibular system senses motion, but your visual system does not. This conflict can lead to motion sickness as the brain prefers aligned sensory inputs.",

      "topic": "ipRGCs, mood regulation, circadian rhythms"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do pigeons and other animals stabilize their head movements while walking?",

      "topic": "animal behavior, vision stabilization"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens in the vestibular system when you experience motion sickness on a plane?",
      "answer": "When on a plane, your vestibular system senses motion even if you're stationary, leading to a conflict with the visual system if you're not looking out the window. This mismatch can cause motion sickness as the brain struggles to reconcile the differing sensory inputs.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "vestibular system, motion sickness"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the midbrain and what functions does it serve?",

      "topic": "superior colliculus, visual processing"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do some people experience pleasure from moving through space, despite motion sickness?",
      "answer": "The pleasure from moving through space, such as skateboarding or cornering in cars, might be related to the activation of reward systems in the brain, potentially involving dopaminergic pathways, although the exact mechanism is not fully understood.",
