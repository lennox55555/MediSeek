      "question": "What is a growth mindset?",
      "answer": "A growth mindset is the belief that abilities are not fixed but malleable, meaning we can improve our skills and intelligence through effort and learning. It involves distancing one's identity from performance and focusing on the process of learning and improving.",

      "topic": "growth mindset, psychology"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does praise for intelligence differ from praise for effort, and what are the implications?",
      "answer": "Praise for intelligence focuses on labels like 'smart' or 'talented,' which can lead individuals to avoid challenges to maintain that label. In contrast, praise for effort emphasizes the process and persistence, encouraging individuals to take on more challenging tasks and improve performance over time.",

      "topic": "praise, performance"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does neuroplasticity play in the concept of growth mindset?",
      "answer": "Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change in response to experience, which supports the growth mindset concept that abilities can be developed. Although neuroplasticity is more robust early in life, it continues throughout adulthood, allowing for learning and improvement at any age.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) play in response to errors in people with different mindsets?",
      "answer": "In people with a fixed mindset, errors trigger greater activity in the rostral or anterior ACC, which is associated with emotional responses. In contrast, those with a growth mindset show more activity in the dorsal ACC, which is linked to cognitive appraisal, allowing them to focus on understanding and correcting errors.",

      "topic": "physiology, stress response"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can stress be both detrimental and beneficial to health and performance?",
      "answer": "Yes, stress can be both detrimental and beneficial. The impact of stress depends on one's mindset. If a person believes stress is harmful, it can diminish performance and health. Conversely, if they believe stress is enhancing, it can improve performance and health by mobilizing resources effectively.",
