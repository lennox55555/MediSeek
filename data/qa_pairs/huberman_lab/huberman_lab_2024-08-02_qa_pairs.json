      "question": "What is the significance of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep for learning and emotional processing?",
      "answer": "REM sleep is crucial for learning, especially on the first night after trying to learn something.

      "topic": "NSDR, REM sleep, sleep research"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are some potential consequences of not getting enough REM sleep?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the effect of physical activity on learning?",
