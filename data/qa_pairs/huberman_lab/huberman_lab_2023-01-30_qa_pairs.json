    },
    {
      "question": "What are some potential negative effects of oral contraceptives on women's health?",
      "answer": "Oral contraceptives can increase inflammatory tone, affect thyroid function, and make the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis more rigid. They also raise sex hormone binding globulin, which can decrease free testosterone, leading to issues like vaginal dryness, reduced sex drive, and decreased confidence and agency.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "oral contraceptives, women's health"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does sex hormone binding globulin affect testosterone levels in women taking oral contraceptives?",
      "answer": "Oral contraceptives raise sex hormone binding globulin, which acts like a sponge soaking up free testosterone. This can lead to a decline in free testosterone levels, affecting women who are sensitive to this change, potentially causing symptoms like vaginal dryness and decreased sex drive.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "sex hormone binding globulin, testosterone"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of measuring AMH levels and follicle count in women, and why is it not commonly done?",
      "answer": "Measuring AMH levels and follicle count can provide insights into a woman's ovarian reserve and fertility status. However, it is not commonly done due to cost and because it is not included in standard blood panels. Typically, only women with disposable income, those wanting to freeze their eggs, or those having trouble conceiving undergo these tests.",

    {
      "question": "Why is it important for women to consider hormone therapy during perimenopause?",
      "answer": "Hormone therapy during perimenopause can help mitigate symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, and sleep difficulties, which are biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease and changes in the brain. Starting hormone therapy within five to ten years of menopause can be beneficial for health outcomes.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between cerebral hypometabolism and menopause, and how might it affect women's health?",
      "answer": "Cerebral hypometabolism, a decline in brain energy metabolism, is linked to the decrease in estrogen starting around age 40. This can lead to symptoms like memory issues and slower cognitive processing, and it may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Addressing this with hormone therapy or metabolic interventions could be beneficial.",
