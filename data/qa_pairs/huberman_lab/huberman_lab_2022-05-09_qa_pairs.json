      "question": "What are the different types of aggression discussed in the podcast?",
      "answer": "The podcast discusses reactive aggression, proactive aggression, and indirect aggression. Reactive aggression occurs when people feel threatened or are protecting loved ones, while proactive aggression involves deliberately trying to harm others. Indirect aggression includes non-physical forms like shaming.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the podcast describe the role of context in understanding aggression?",
      "answer": "The podcast emphasizes that context is crucial in understanding aggression. For example, maternal aggression is seen as adaptive when a mother protects her children, while unprovoked proactive aggression is generally viewed negatively.",

      "topic": "context in aggression"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and its role in aggression?",
      "answer": "The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is a small collection of neurons in the brain that is both necessary and sufficient to generate aggressive behavior. It plays a central role in the neural circuits that mediate aggression.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the ventromedial hypothalamus relate to aggressive behavior?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the common misconception about testosterone and aggression?",
      "answer": "The misconception is that testosterone directly increases aggression. In reality, testosterone increases competitiveness and proactivity, and it is the conversion of testosterone to estrogen in the brain that triggers aggression.",

      "topic": "circadian rhythms, aggression"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does serotonin play in aggression?",
