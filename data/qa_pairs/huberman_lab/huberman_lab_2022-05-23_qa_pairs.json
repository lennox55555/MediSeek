      "question": "How does exercise affect brain function, particularly in relation to memory and focus?",
      "answer": "Exercise releases neurochemicals like dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and a growth factor called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is crucial because it helps grow new brain cells in the hippocampus, which is associated with memory and focus. Regular exercise can lead to a 'big fat, fluffy hippocampus,' enhancing memory retention and focus.",

      "topic": "exercise types, brain health"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two pathways through which exercise increases BDNF levels in the brain?",
      "answer": "The first pathway involves myokines, proteins released by muscles during exercise, which pass the blood-brain barrier and stimulate BDNF release in the brain. The second pathway involves the liver releasing a ketone called beta-hydroxybutyrate during exercise, which also stimulates BDNF production.",
