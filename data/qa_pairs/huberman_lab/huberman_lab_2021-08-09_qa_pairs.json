      "question": "What is the role of dopamine in motivation and how does it differ from its common association with pleasure?",
      "answer": "Dopamine is a neuromodulator that plays a crucial role in motivation and anticipation rather than pleasure. It is released in anticipation of a reward, making us feel activated and motivated to pursue goals. When the reward is received, dopamine levels drop back to baseline. Intermittent reward schedules can increase dopamine release, enhancing motivation and focus.",

    {
      "question": "How does the skin function as a sensory organ in the context of pleasure and pain?",
      "answer": "The skin is the largest sensory organ and contains neurons that detect various stimuli such as light touch, temperature, and pressure. These neurons send signals to the brain, which interprets them as sensations of pleasure or pain. The skin's sensory receptors are distributed unevenly, with higher densities in areas like the lips and fingertips, leading to more sensitive touch perception.",
