      "topic": "brain development, childhood attachment"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the right hemisphere play in emotional development and attachment?",
      "answer": "The right hemisphere is involved in processing emotional information and is dominant during early childhood. It is crucial for developing attachment styles, such as secure, avoidant, or anxious attachment, by mediating emotional resonance and regulation with primary caretakers.",
