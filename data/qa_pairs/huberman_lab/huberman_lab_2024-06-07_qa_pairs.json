      "question": "What are the potential health effects of nicotine consumption?",
      "answer": "Nicotine itself does not cause cancer; rather, it's the mode of consumption like smoking, vaping, dipping, or snuffing that causes cancer. Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, enhancing cognitive functions such as attention and focus, but it also raises blood pressure and causes vasoconstriction.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does nicotine function as a cognitive enhancer?",
      "answer": "Nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are involved in muscle contraction and cognitive processes. This binding can enhance focus, alertness, and learning by increasing acetylcholine activation and potentially maintaining dopaminergic neurons.",

      "question": "What are 'exercise snacks' and how can they benefit one's health?",
      "answer": "Exercise snacks are short, intense bouts of physical activity, such as a 60-second run up the stairs or a minute of jumping jacks. They can raise heart rate and adjust physiology in a way that improves performance, including VO2 max, even if they are not the only form of exercise one should do.",

      "answer": "Starting TRT at a young age can dramatically lower sperm count in males, which is a concern for those wanting to conceive children. It is advised to first optimize behaviors like sleep, exercise, and nutrition before considering TRT. If TRT is pursued, minimal effective doses should be used, and additional measures like human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) may be needed to offset fertility issues.",
