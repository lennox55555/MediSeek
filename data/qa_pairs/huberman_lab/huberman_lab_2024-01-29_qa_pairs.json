    {
      "question": "What is working memory and how is it different from long-term and short-term memory?",
      "answer": "Working memory is a type of memory that allows us to hold small amounts of information in our mind for short periods of time. It is closely related to attention and is used for tasks that require immediate information processing, which is then discarded. Unlike long-term memory, which involves the hippocampus and neuroplasticity for storing information, working memory does not involve robust neuroplasticity and is more about processing and forgetting information quickly.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "working memory, memory types"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the hippocampus contribute to memory formation?",
      "answer": "The hippocampus is a key structure in the brain essential for the formation and storage of long-term memories. It is involved in the passage of short-term memories into long-term memories and is part of a larger neural network that distributes some long-term memories into the neocortex.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "hippocampus, memory formation"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does dopamine play in working memory?",
      "answer": "Dopamine, a neuromodulator, is crucial for working memory. It is released from neurons in the brainstem to the prefrontal cortex, and the amount of dopamine released strongly dictates working memory capacity. However, more dopamine does not always equate to better working memory; there is an optimal level for its effectiveness.",
      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "dopamine, working memory"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can neurogenesis significantly impact adult learning and memory?",
      "answer": "While neurogenesis, the formation of new neurons, does occur in adults, it is not the main mechanism for learning and memory in adults. The amount of neurogenesis is small compared to other forms of neuroplasticity like long-term potentiation and depression, which are more critical for memory formation.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "neurogenesis, adult learning"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is long-term potentiation (LTP) and how does it relate to memory?",
      "answer": "Long-term potentiation (LTP) is the strengthening of connections between neurons due to their repeated firing together in time. This process is crucial for the formation of both short-term and long-term memories, as it enhances the communication between neurons, making it easier for them to transmit information.",

      "topic": "long-term potentiation, neuroplasticity"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is working memory important for daily activities?",
      "answer": "Working memory is essential for sequencing actions and making decisions in real-time without committing those sequences to long-term memory. It allows individuals to perform tasks like preparing for a run or making coffee by holding necessary information temporarily and discarding it once the task is complete.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "working memory, daily activities"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can one assess their working memory capacity?",
      "answer": "Working memory capacity can be assessed through tasks that require remembering sequences of letters or numbers. The ability to recall these sequences immediately after presentation indicates working memory capacity, with longer sequences indicating higher capacity.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "working memory assessment"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does dopamine affect working memory capacity?",
      "answer": "Dopamine is the dominant neuromodulator for regulating working memory capacity in the prefrontal cortex. Higher levels of dopamine correlate with better working memory performance, while lower levels correlate with reduced capacity.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "dopamine, working memory"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the effect of introducing norepinephrine or serotonin to the prefrontal cortex in the study?",

      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "neuromodulators, working memory"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why might increasing dopamine levels not always improve working memory?",
      "answer": "Increasing dopamine levels beyond a certain point can actually degrade working memory performance. This follows an inverted U-shaped function, where too much dopamine can reduce working memory span below baseline levels.",
      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "dopamine, working memory"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between working memory and attention in the context of ADHD?",
