    },
    {
      "question": "What is an absence seizure and how does it differ from other types of seizures?",
      "answer": "An absence seizure is a type of seizure where a person loses consciousness and is not fully aware of their environment, yet may still be standing. This differs from other seizures like grand mal seizures, which involve convulsions, or temporal lobe seizures, which can involve unusual tastes or smells.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is the traditional understanding of Broca's and Wernicke's areas in speech and language processing?",
      "answer": "The traditional understanding is that Broca's area is responsible for speech production and Wernicke's area for comprehension. However, recent research suggests that this view is oversimplified and sometimes incorrect, as other brain areas are also involved in these processes.",

      "topic": "neuroscience, speech and language processing"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is language processing in the brain lateralized, and how does handedness relate to this?",
      "answer": "Language processing is typically lateralized to the left hemisphere in right-handed individuals. Handedness is strongly genetic and can influence which hemisphere is dominant for language. In left-handed people, language is still often on the left side, but more frequently than in right-handed individuals, it can be on the right or in both hemispheres.",

    {
      "question": "How does the ear process different sounds?",

      "topic": "hearing, sound processing"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the cortex play in processing speech sounds?",

      "topic": "neuroscience, speech processing"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between vocalizations like crying and speech in terms of brain processing?",

      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "vocalization, brain function"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the larynx contribute to the production of speech?",
      "answer": "The larynx brings the vocal folds together during exhalation, causing them to vibrate and produce sound. This sound is then shaped by the mouth, tongue, and lips to form consonants and vowels.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "speech production, larynx function"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between reading and the brain's speech processing areas?",

      "topic": "reading, brain function"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it possible for someone to spontaneously speak a new language after a stroke?",
      "answer": "There are no documented cases of someone spontaneously speaking a new language fluently after a stroke. However, there is a condition called foreign accent syndrome, where a person may sound like they are speaking another language due to changes in speech intonation and phonology after a brain injury.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "language, stroke, foreign accent syndrome"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the brain store auditory memories, and are they localized to a specific area?",
      "answer": "Auditory memories are distributed across multiple areas of the brain rather than localized to a specific area. This distributed nature helps preserve memories even if certain parts of the brain are injured.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "auditory memory, brain function"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Bravo trial, and what does it aim to achieve?",

      "topic": "brain-machine interface, speech, paralysis"
    },
    {
      "question": "How are facial expressions important in communication?",
      "answer": "Facial expressions are a crucial part of communication as they convey nonverbal cues that help in understanding the speaker's emotions and intentions. They also aid in speech comprehension by allowing the listener to see the speaker's mouth movements, which enhances the auditory perception of speech.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "communication, facial expressions"
    },
    {
      "question": "What advancements are being made for individuals who are locked-in, like Poncho?",

    {
      "question": "How does stuttering relate to brain function and anxiety?",
      "answer": "Stuttering is a speech condition affecting the articulation and coordination of movements in the vocal tract. While anxiety can exacerbate stuttering, it is not the root cause. The condition involves a breakdown in the precise coordination required for fluent speech, and auditory feedback plays a role in this process.",

      "topic": "stuttering, speech disorders"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does exercise play in the mental state of a neurosurgeon?",
      "answer": "Exercise, such as running or swimming, is used primarily for mental reasons by the neurosurgeon. It helps in disconnecting from daily stressors and improves focus and interaction with others. The operating room also serves as a space for intense focus, similar to the mental state achieved through exercise.",
