      "question": "What is ADHD and how does it differ from normal focus levels?",
      "answer": "ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is a condition characterized by difficulties in maintaining attention, impulse control, and organization. It differs from normal focus levels as individuals with ADHD often struggle with tasks they are not interested in, but can hyper-focus on things they enjoy. Normal focus involves the ability to concentrate on tasks regardless of interest.",
