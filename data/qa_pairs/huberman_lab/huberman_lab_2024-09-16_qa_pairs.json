    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between apology and forgiveness as discussed in the transcript?",
      "answer": "Apology is a dyadic experience involving two people and is about acknowledging and taking responsibility for a wrongdoing.

      "answer": "Naming in therapy provides a framework and foundation for understanding, allowing for shared language and communication.
