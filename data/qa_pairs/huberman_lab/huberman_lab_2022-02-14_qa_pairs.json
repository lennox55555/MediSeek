    },
    {
      "question": "Can increasing dopamine levels alone effectively enhance libido?",
      "answer": "No, simply increasing dopamine levels will not necessarily enhance libido. While dopamine is involved in motivation and drive, excessive dopamine can lead to high arousal states that prevent physical arousal necessary for sexual activity. A balance in the autonomic nervous system is crucial.",
      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "dopamine, libido, autonomic nervous system"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are some supplements that have been shown to increase libido?",
