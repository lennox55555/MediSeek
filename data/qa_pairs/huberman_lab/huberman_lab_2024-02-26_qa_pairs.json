      "answer": "Sturdiness in parenting refers to the ability to be connected to oneself and to someone else at the same time.

      "question": "How does Dr. Becky Kennedy define boundaries in the context of parenting?",
      "answer": "Dr. Becky Kennedy defines boundaries as things we tell people we will do, which require the other person to do nothing. Boundaries are meant to keep us connected to ourselves, represent our values, wants, and needs, and in a parent-child relationship, they also keep children safe.",

      "question": "Why is it important for parents to understand their job in the context of parenting?",
      "answer": "Understanding their job is crucial for parents because, without a clear job description, it is impossible to perform well and achieve desired outcomes. Dr. Becky Kennedy emphasizes that parents have two main jobs: setting boundaries and showing empathy and validation. These roles help in maintaining a sturdy relationship with their children.",

    {
      "question": "What role do empathy and validation play in parenting according to Dr. Becky Kennedy?",
      "answer": "Empathy and validation are essential in parenting as they allow parents to connect with their children's feelings and experiences as real. This connection does not mean agreeing with or condoning the behavior, but rather recognizing the feelings behind it. This approach helps children learn emotion regulation and feel understood.",

    {
      "question": "Why is it important for parents to validate their children's feelings?",
      "answer": "Validating a child's feelings helps them build confidence and self-trust. When parents acknowledge their child's emotions by saying 'I believe you,' it reinforces the child's sense of reality and makes them feel understood and supported. This validation can prevent children from feeling isolated in their emotions and helps them develop a healthy sense of self.",

      "question": "How can the concept of 'impingement' be applied in parenting decisions?",
      "answer": "Impingement refers to the balance between respecting a child's natural desires and setting necessary boundaries. Parents should allow children some autonomy in their choices, like deciding whether to join a family activity or not, while also teaching them the importance of participating in family experiences. This balance helps children learn to navigate situations they might not prefer, which is important for their development.",

      "question": "What role does 'repair' play in preventing trauma in children?",
      "answer": "Repair involves addressing and discussing a negative event with a child to prevent it from becoming traumatic. When a child experiences a distressing event, like being yelled at, it's crucial for the parent to reconnect and discuss the incident. This helps the child process the event with support, rather than in isolation, which can prevent the development of self-blame or self-doubt.",

    {
      "question": "How does the phrase 'I believe you' differ from 'I hear you' in terms of impact on a child's confidence?",
      "answer": "The phrase 'I believe you' is more powerful because it affirms the child's reality and emotions, making them feel validated and understood. It conveys trust in the child's experience, which can significantly boost their confidence. In contrast, 'I hear you' is more about acknowledging that the child has been listened to, but it doesn't necessarily validate their feelings as real or justified.",

      "question": "What is the potential impact of unresolved childhood events on adult behavior?",
      "answer": "Unresolved childhood events, especially those processed in isolation, can lead to adults who struggle with self-blame and self-doubt. When children are left to process distressing events alone, they may internalize negative beliefs about themselves or doubt their perceptions. This can manifest in adulthood as a tendency to question one's feelings or seek external validation for personal experiences.",

      "question": "What is the first step in the repair process after a parent yells at their child?",
      "answer": "The first step in the repair process is for the parent to repair with themselves. This involves separating their identity from their behavior and acknowledging that they are a good parent who did something they are not proud of. This self-repair is crucial before attempting to repair the relationship with the child.",

    {
      "question": "Why might children reject their parents' apologies?",
      "answer": "Children often reject apologies because they are not genuine repairs. Parents might ask for forgiveness or say things like 'I'm sorry you felt that way,' which are not true apologies. These statements can make children feel like they are being blamed for the parent's actions, leading to a lack of trust and distance.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How can parents effectively handle a child's retort of 'I hate you'?",
      "answer": "Parents can handle such retorts by doing nothing initially, allowing the child to process their emotions. It's important to understand the child's feelings before intervening. A parent might also validate the child's feelings by acknowledging their disappointment and setting boundaries, such as saying, 'I love you, you're a good kid having a hard time, but I won't stay in the room while you keep saying this.'",

    {
      "question": "What role does identity play in a parent's ability to apologize effectively?",
      "answer": "Identity is crucial because it helps separate a parent's actions from their self-worth. By affirming their identity with statements like 'I am a good parent having a hard time,' parents can better manage their emotions and offer genuine apologies. This separation allows them to approach their child with sincerity and without seeking validation.",

      "question": "What are 'deeply feeling kids' and how should parents approach them?",
      "answer": "Deeply feeling kids are those who experience emotions intensely and may have strong reactions like tantrums. Parents should approach these children by being firm yet warm, setting boundaries, and not being afraid of their emotions. It's important to validate their feelings while also teaching them emotional regulation skills.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why do some children seem to experience their emotions more intensely than others?",
      "answer": "Some children, referred to as 'deeply feeling kids,' experience emotions intensely due to their vulnerability being closely tied to their shame. This intense emotional experience can lead to explosive reactions and a deep fear of abandonment, which makes them feel like their emotions are attacking them.",

      "question": "How can parents effectively communicate with deeply feeling children who reject typical parenting strategies?",
      "answer": "Parents should avoid direct approaches and instead find 'side door' methods to communicate with deeply feeling children. These children may perceive attempts to validate their feelings as intrusive, so it's important to create a safe environment for them to express their emotions without feeling overwhelmed.",

      "answer": "There is an observed overlap between deeply feeling children and those with neurodivergence or ADHD.

      "question": "What role does frustration tolerance play in a child's development, and how can parents help build it?",
      "answer": "Frustration tolerance is crucial for a child's development as it helps them navigate the learning space between not knowing and successfully doing something. Parents can help by allowing children to experience and work through frustration rather than immediately providing solutions, thus lengthening their ability to stay in the learning space.",

      "question": "How can co-parents align their parenting strategies when they have different approaches?",
      "answer": "Co-parents can align their strategies by focusing on the child's needs and understanding their experiences rather than centering on what the other parent is doing wrong. It's important to communicate and possibly engage in joint courses or discussions to find common ground, ensuring that the child feels supported and not isolated.",

      "question": "Why is it important for the brain to experience 'limbic friction' during learning?",
      "answer": "Limbic friction is important during learning because it represents the challenge and effort required to change the nervous system. The brain changes only when neuromodulators like epinephrine and adrenaline signal that the nervous system needs to change, which occurs when we do things that are difficult or that we don't want to do. This process helps build resilience and willpower.",

      "question": "How can parents support their teenagers in forming their own identities?",
      "answer": "Parents can support their teenagers by understanding that a teen's job is to separate and form their own identity. This involves allowing them to take space and explore who they are while still providing a home base. Parents should be prepared for feelings of loss and sadness as their children seek independence, and they should continue to make efforts to connect, showing that they are still there for their teens.",

      "question": "What role does the anterior mid cingulate cortex play in resilience and willpower?",
      "answer": "The anterior mid cingulate cortex is activated when people engage in activities they don't want to do, which helps build resilience and willpower. This brain area is highly plastic and can be strengthened by doing hard things, which translates to success in various areas such as academics and other environments.",

    {
      "question": "Why is it beneficial for children to explore a wide range of emotions?",
      "answer": "Exploring a wide range of emotions helps children build resilience by learning to tolerate various emotional experiences. This understanding can be enhanced by teaching children to identify and name their emotions, which can lead to better emotional tolerance and understanding.",

      "question": "How can parents assess if their teenager's behavior is problematic and requires intervention?",
      "answer": "Parents can assess problematic behavior by observing changes in their child's overall functioning, such as a decline in school performance, withdrawal from social activities, or increased conflict at home. If a child's world becomes limited due to behaviors like substance use, it's a sign to seek additional support.",

    {
      "question": "What role does witnessing parental conflict play in a child's development?",
      "answer": "Witnessing parental conflict can be impactful, but the key factor is whether the conflict is acknowledged and discussed with the child. If parents address the conflict and communicate with their child about it, it can mitigate negative effects. Unaddressed conflict can lead to issues like tantrums or school problems as children manifest their struggles.",

    {
      "question": "How can parents help their children develop resilience and avoid entitlement?",
      "answer": "Parents can help their children develop resilience by exposing them to small, everyday frustrations and not always shielding them from discomfort.
