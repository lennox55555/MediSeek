    },
    {
      "question": "What is 'weak central coherence' and how does it relate to anorexia?",
      "answer": "Weak central coherence is the inability to see the bigger picture due to a focus on details. In anorexics, this manifests as an intense focus on the caloric and fat content of foods, which can drive their eating behaviors and make it difficult for them to enjoy meals normally.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "anorexia, cognitive processes"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of cognitive behavioral therapy in treating anorexia?",
      "answer": "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is often combined with habit recognition and rewiring approaches to treat anorexia.
