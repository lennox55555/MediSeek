      "topic": "neurotransmitters, dopamine, epinephrine"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the levels of neuromodulators like dopamine and serotonin change throughout the day?",
      "answer": "From zero to nine hours after waking, dopamine and epinephrine levels are at their highest. From nine to sixteen hours, serotonin levels start to increase as dopamine and epinephrine subside. During sleep, there is a chaotic fluctuation of neuromodulators, except for epinephrine, which is generally not released.",

      "topic": "B vitamins, dopamine regulation, prolactin"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it recommended to delay caffeine intake after waking up?",
      "answer": "Delaying caffeine intake by 90 to 120 minutes after waking can help avoid an afternoon crash. This is because caffeine increases epinephrine and limits sleepiness, and delaying its intake helps maintain energy levels throughout the day.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "caffeine, energy levels"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does cyclic hyperventilation increase energy levels?",
