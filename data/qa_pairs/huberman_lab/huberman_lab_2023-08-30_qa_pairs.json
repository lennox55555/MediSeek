      "question": "Why is it difficult to isolate the benefits of nature in scientific studies?",
      "answer": "Isolating the benefits of nature is difficult because it involves hundreds, if not thousands, of variables such as sunlight, wildlife, and air quality. Trying to isolate these in a laboratory setting can diminish the overall understanding of nature's benefits.",
