      "question": "What is bipolar disorder and how does it affect individuals?",
      "answer": "Bipolar disorder, often referred to as bipolar depression, is a condition characterized by massive shifts in energy, perception, and mood. These shifts are maladaptive and can cause significant harm to both the individual suffering from the disorder and those around them. It is a severe condition with a 20 to 30 times greater risk of suicide compared to the general population.",
