      "question": "What is neuroplasticity and why is it unique to the nervous system?",
      "answer": "Neuroplasticity is the ability of the nervous system to change itself in response to experience and conscious effort. It is unique because no other organ in the body has this capability, allowing the nervous system to govern who we are, how we feel, and what we do.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "neuroplasticity, nervous system"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the somatosensory system process physical sensations?",
      "answer": "The somatosensory system processes physical sensations through sensors in the skin that respond to mechanical touch, heat, cold, and vibration. These sensors send electrical signals via axons to the spinal cord and brain, where the signals are interpreted.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "somatosensory system, sensory processing"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between pain and nociception?",
      "answer": "Pain is a subjective experience with both mental and physical components, while nociception refers to the sensory process that provides signals that trigger pain. Nociceptors are the sensors in the skin that detect harmful stimuli.",
      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "pain, nociception"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can visual imagery be used to alleviate phantom limb pain?",
      "answer": "Visual imagery can alleviate phantom limb pain using a mirror box technique, where the intact limb is reflected to appear as the missing limb. This visual feedback can help remap the brain's representation of the missing limb, reducing the sensation of pain.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "phantom limb pain, visual imagery"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is inflammation important in the healing process?",
      "answer": "Inflammation is the tissue repair response and is essential for healing. While excessive inflammation can be harmful, controlled inflammation helps repair tissue and is crucial for recovery after injury.",

      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "sodium channel, pain perception"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can restricting movement of an uninjured limb aid in recovery from injury?",
      "answer": "Restricting movement of an uninjured limb can aid recovery by encouraging use of the injured limb, promoting neural plasticity and balance between the two sides of the body. This approach can speed up recovery by preventing asymmetry in neural pathways.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "injury recovery, neural plasticity"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the principle behind overworking an injured side of the body during recovery?",

      "type": "general",
      "topic": "injury recovery, neural plasticity"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the glymphatic system contribute to brain health, especially after a traumatic brain injury (TBI)?",

      "topic": "slow-wave sleep, glymphatic system"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can one's sleeping position affect the glymphatic system's efficiency?",
      "answer": "Sleeping on one side or with feet slightly elevated can increase the efficiency of the glymphatic system, enhancing the clearance of brain debris due to the physical pressure dynamics of the system.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "sleep position, glymphatic system"
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of exercise is recommended to support the glymphatic system and brain health?",

      "type": "general",
      "topic": "exercise, brain health"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does infatuation or obsessive love influence the perception of pain?",
      "answer": "Infatuation or obsessive love can significantly blunt the perception of pain, likely due to the release of dopamine, which modulates the pain response and increases pain tolerance.",

      "topic": "norepinephrine, pain management, inflammation"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is acute inflammation considered beneficial?",

      "topic": "brain health, aging, cognitive function"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the perception of pain differ from actual tissue damage?",
      "answer": "Perception of pain is not the same as actual tissue damage. There is a subjective component to pain, meaning individuals can have some control over their experience of pain. Treatment can involve addressing pain receptors at the site of the wound, but not all pain management requires drugs or specific therapeutics.",
