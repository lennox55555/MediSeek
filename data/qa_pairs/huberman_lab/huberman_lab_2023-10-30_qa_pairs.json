    {
      "question": "Why is it important to combine pharmacological treatments with talk therapy for mood and mental health improvement?",
      "answer": "Pharmacological treatments like SSRIs and psilocybin open opportunities for neuroplasticity, but for these changes to lead to lasting improvements, they need to be directed towards specific endpoints through talk therapy. This ensures that neuroplastic changes lead to stable improvements in mood and mental health.",

      "question": "Why is it important to use language that matches the magnitude of trauma when processing it?",
      "answer": "Using language that matches the magnitude of trauma is important because it allows individuals to express the true impact of the trauma. When people downplay their language, they may not fully process the trauma, which can lead to it rooting in the unconscious mind and manifesting in negative ways, such as increased anxiety or sleep disruptions.",
