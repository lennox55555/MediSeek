      "question": "What are peptides and why are they becoming popular in medicine?",
      "answer": "Peptides are chains of amino acids, with 40 or fewer amino acids being classified as peptides and more than 40 as proteins. They are naturally occurring in the body and perform various roles. Peptide therapies are gaining popularity because they can augment specific hormone pathways and processes in the brain and body to improve health without shutting down the body's natural production of those hormones, unlike some hormone therapies.",

    {
      "question": "What are the differences between NAD, NMN, and NR in terms of their effects and administration?",
      "answer": "NAD is often administered intravenously for its transformative effects on energy and cognitive function, with a typical dose being 750 milligrams. NMN is taken sublingually and is noted for effects like faster hair and nail growth. NR, which is NAD minus the phosphate group, can be taken orally and has some evidence of reducing inflammation. However, NMN is preferred for its cost-effectiveness compared to NR.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why might the FDA ban certain peptides despite their clinical benefits?",
      "answer": "The FDA may ban certain peptides due to concerns about safety and the need for oversight, as the peptide market can resemble the 'wild wild west' with limited regulation. However, there is also a perspective that these bans may facilitate pharmaceutical companies in turning these peptides into high-profit drugs.",
