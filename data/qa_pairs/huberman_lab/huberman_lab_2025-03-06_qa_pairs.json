      "question": "What are the main roles of thyroid hormone in the body?",
      "answer": "Thyroid hormone, specifically T3, promotes metabolism by utilizing energy for tissue growth and repair. It acts on muscles, liver, cartilage, and bone, and is involved in converting fats and sugars into energy. Higher thyroid levels are associated with leaner bodies.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "Thyroid Hormone, Metabolism"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does iodine contribute to thyroid hormone production?",
      "answer": "Iodine is essential for thyroid hormone production as it combines with the amino acid L-tyrosine in the thyroid to produce T3 and T4 hormones. Most people get enough iodine from sea salt, kelp, seaweed, and iodized table salt.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "Thyroid Hormone, Nutrition"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between selenium and thyroid function?",
      "answer": "Selenium is crucial for thyroid hormone production as it facilitates the interaction between L-tyrosine and iodine. Many people may not get enough selenium, which is found in foods like Brazil nuts, fish, and certain meats.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "Thyroid Hormone, Nutrition"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is growth hormone important for metabolism and tissue repair?",
      "answer": "Growth hormone increases metabolism and aids in the repair and growth of tissues such as muscle, ligaments, bone, and fat. It is released during slow-wave sleep and is crucial for maintaining metabolic functions and reducing body fat.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "Growth Hormone, Metabolism"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does exercise influence growth hormone levels?",
      "answer": "Exercise, particularly weight training or endurance training of about 60 minutes with a proper warm-up, can increase growth hormone levels by 300 to 500%. It is important to have low blood glucose during exercise to maximize this effect.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "Growth Hormone, Exercise"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the potential risks of using growth hormone replacement therapy?",
      "answer": "Growth hormone replacement therapy can cause excessive growth of all tissues, including the heart, lungs, and liver, if levels are too high. It is important to use such therapies under medical supervision.",
      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "Growth Hormone, Therapy"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does slow-wave sleep play in growth hormone release?",
      "answer": "Slow-wave sleep is crucial for growth hormone release due to delta wave activity in the brain, which stimulates the pituitary gland to release growth hormone. This process is essential for tissue repair and metabolic functions.",
      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "Growth Hormone, Sleep"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can sauna use affect growth hormone levels?",
      "answer": "Using a sauna can increase growth hormone release by up to 16-fold. The protocol involves 20 minutes in the sauna, 30 minutes of cooling, and another 20 minutes in the sauna, repeated over several days.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "Growth Hormone, Sauna"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of peptides in growth hormone regulation?",
      "answer": "Peptides like sermorelin can mimic growth hormone releasing hormone, stimulating growth hormone release from the pituitary. They can alter gene expression and have long-term effects, but also carry risks such as promoting tumor growth.",
      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "Growth Hormone, Peptides"
    },
    {
      "question": "What dietary components are essential for maintaining healthy thyroid function?",
      "answer": "To maintain healthy thyroid function, it is essential to consume adequate iodine, selenium, and L-tyrosine. These nutrients are found in sea salt, kelp, seaweed, Brazil nuts, fish, and certain meats.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "Thyroid Hormone, Nutrition"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the brain influence the body's hormone production?",
      "answer": "The brain tells the body what hormones to make, which then influence all the tissues of the body.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "brain function, hormone production"
    },
    {
      "question": "In what ways do hormones affect the brain's functions?",
      "answer": "Hormones tell the brain whether or not to eat more, grow more, or think more.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "hormone influence, brain activity"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it important for the brain to regulate hormone production?",
      "answer": "The regulation of hormone production by the brain is crucial because hormones influence all the tissues of the body and provide feedback to the brain on various functions like eating, growing, and thinking.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "hormone regulation, brain-body interaction"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role do hormones play in communication between the brain and body?",
