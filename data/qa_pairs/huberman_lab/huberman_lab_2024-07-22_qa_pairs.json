      "topic": "menstrual cycle, exercise"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the menstrual cycle affect women's appetite and training needs?",
      "answer": "During the menstrual cycle, estrogen surges before ovulation, dampening appetite. After ovulation, estrogen dips, and progesterone increases, leading to cravings but not necessarily hunger. Women should focus on fueling appropriately for exercise, even if they're not hungry, to prevent catabolic states and maintain proper signaling from the brain to the body.",
