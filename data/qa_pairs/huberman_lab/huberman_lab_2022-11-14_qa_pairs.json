      "question": "How does income relative to cost of living affect stress levels?",
      "answer": "Income relative to cost of living can significantly affect stress levels. While an increase in income might seem beneficial, if the cost of living in a new location is much higher, it can lead to increased stress. This is because it's not just the absolute income that matters, but how it compares to the cost of living and the ability to engage in desired social activities.",

      "question": "What is synthetic happiness and how does it differ from natural happiness?",
      "answer": "Synthetic happiness refers to the happiness we can create for ourselves through internal processes, such as reframing choices or engaging in meaningful activities, rather than relying on external acquisitions like material goods. It is based on principles of neurobiology and dopamine rewards. Natural happiness, on the other hand, is the happiness derived from achieving expected life milestones or acquiring things, such as completing a degree or finding a mate.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "happiness, psychology"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the environment influence our ability to synthesize happiness?",
      "answer": "The environment plays a crucial role in our ability to synthesize happiness. While certain environmental factors like music or visual elements can induce states of joy, they are not sufficient on their own. Individuals must also make a conscious effort to engage in activities that bring them meaning and joy. This interaction between environment and personal effort is key to creating synthetic happiness.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "environment, happiness"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does dopamine play in the anticipation of rewards and happiness?",
      "answer": "Dopamine is involved in the anticipation of rewards, which often leads to greater increases in neurochemicals that support happiness and wellbeing than the actual acquisition of the reward itself. This highlights the importance of the anticipation phase in the experience of happiness, as discussed in relation to the dopamine system and synthetic happiness.",
      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "dopamine, neurobiology"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can pro-social spending influence personal happiness?",
      "answer": "Pro-social spending, which involves giving a portion of one's income to others or causes, is associated with significantly greater happiness. Studies have shown that the manner in which people spend their bonuses, particularly when spent on others, is a more important predictor of happiness than the size of the bonus itself. This suggests that giving can enhance personal happiness.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "pro-social spending, happiness"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the study 'A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind'?",
      "answer": "The study 'A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind' by Killingsworth and Gilbert highlights that a tendency for the mind to wander is associated with lower levels of happiness. This suggests that focusing on the present and reducing mind wandering can be an effective way to increase happiness.",

      "topic": "mindfulness, happiness"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why might synthetic happiness be considered more potent than natural happiness?",
      "answer": "Synthetic happiness might be considered more potent than natural happiness because it is more under our control and can be more persistent. It involves actively engaging in practices that create happiness internally, rather than relying solely on external circumstances or acquisitions, which can be fleeting.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "synthetic happiness, psychology"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main finding regarding mind wandering and happiness from the study discussed in the podcast?",
      "answer": "The study found that people tend to be less happy when their minds wander from the activity they are engaged in, regardless of whether they enjoy the activity or not. Staying focused on the current activity, even if it's not enjoyable, tends to result in higher reported levels of happiness.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does brief meditation impact focus and mood according to the podcast?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does eye contact influence social connection during conversations?",

    {
      "question": "Why do people on their deathbeds often emphasize the importance of social connections?",
      "answer": "People on their deathbeds often talk about the richness of social connections or wish they had invested more in them because deep social connections, which can involve physical contact, are deeply rooted in our evolutionary biology and contribute significantly to happiness.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "social connections, happiness"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does having too many choices affect our happiness according to the discussed experiments?",
      "answer": "The experiments show that having too many ongoing choices leads to reduced levels of happiness. When people are forced to stick to a choice, they tend to be happier with it than if they have the option to change their mind.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "choice, happiness"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the prefrontal cortex in decision-making and how does it relate to happiness?",
      "answer": "The prefrontal cortex is involved in decision-making and evaluating different options. It is metabolically demanding, and its engagement can lead to ego depletion. This affects our ability to focus and impacts the reward circuitry of the brain, which is crucial for happiness.",
      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "neuroscience, decision-making"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the two components of happiness as framed in the discussion?",

    {
      "question": "How does income level relate to happiness, and what is the concept of a 'buffer' in this context?",
      "answer": "Income level matters for happiness as it can cover living costs and provide a buffer against anxiety about potential negative changes. The buffer varies from person to person and helps mitigate stress related to financial instability.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "income, happiness"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is synthetic happiness and how can it be achieved?",
