      "question": "What are some common causes of back pain according to Dr. Stuart McGill?",
      "answer": "Dr. Stuart McGill explains that back pain is a symptom with numerous pathways and mechanisms. It can be influenced by genetics, which 'loads the gun,' and exposure, which 'pulls the trigger.' The psychosocial environment around an individual also affects how they respond to the pain.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How does the anatomy of the spine contribute to its function and potential for injury?",
      "answer": "The spine is composed of vertebrae separated by discs, which are not ball and socket joints but rather layers of collagen fibers. This structure provides both flexibility and stiffness, allowing for movement and load-bearing. The facet joints guide motion, and their angles can influence the ability to twist, which is genetically determined. The design of the spine is an evolutionary adaptation to balance flexibility and stability.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What role do genetics play in determining an individual's susceptibility to back pain?",
      "answer": "Genetics can influence the structure of the spine, such as the shape of the discs and the angles of the facet joints, which can predispose individuals to certain types of movement or stress. For example, people with more ovoid discs are better suited for activities requiring flexibility, while those with limon-shaped discs can handle more compressive loads. These genetic factors can determine one's suitability for different sports and activities.",

      "topic": "genetics, spine biomechanics"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it important to consider individual anatomical differences when choosing physical activities?",
      "answer": "Individual anatomical differences, such as spine structure and joint flexibility, can affect how a person responds to different physical activities. Engaging in activities that are not aligned with one's genetic predispositions can lead to injury. For instance, a person with a thicker spine may not be suited for activities requiring high flexibility, while a willowy person might need to build musculature for strength-based activities.",
