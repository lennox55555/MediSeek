      "topic": "NAD supplementation, longevity"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the differences in bioavailability between NR and NMN when taken orally?",
      "answer": "NR can cross the cell membrane directly and easily, while NMN cannot due to its phosphate group. When NMN is ingested, the phosphate group is cleaved in the gut, which may affect its efficacy compared to NR.",
      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "NAD precursors, bioavailability"
    },
    {
      "question": "What were the findings of the Interventions Testing Program (ITP) regarding NR's effect on lifespan?",
      "answer": "The ITP found that NR did not extend lifespan or improve healthspan in mice, even at high doses. This suggests that NR may not have the expected benefits for longevity.",
