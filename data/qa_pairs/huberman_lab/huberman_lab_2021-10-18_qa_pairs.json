      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "artificial sweeteners, insulin management"
    },
    {
      "question": "How can one's perception of food influence its taste and health benefits?",
      "answer": "Believing that a food is good for you and beneficial for brain metabolism can influence how it tastes and how your body utilizes it, potentially making it more palatable over time.",

      "topic": "food pairing, brain metabolism"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do foods impact our brain and its health?",
      "answer": "Foods impact our brain by influencing how it responds to food, which is largely a learned response. Certain foods can evoke strong reactions, and consistently consuming highly palatable foods can shift our dopamine system, affecting our perception of what tastes good.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can people with metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes rewire their food preferences?",

      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "metabolic disorders, food preference"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the dopamine system play in food preference?",
      "answer": "The dopamine system is activated by highly palatable foods, making us believe these foods are the only ones that can trigger the reward system and taste good. However, this system can adapt to less sweet or savory foods over time.",

      "topic": "dopamine system, food preference"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the research by Dana Small and others on food reward systems?",

      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "food reward systems, metabolic disorders"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between food reward and food reinforcement?",
      "answer": "Food reward and food reinforcement are slightly different concepts. The review 'Rethinking Food Reward' explores these differences and how they impact our brain and body, influencing why we like certain foods and how to reshape our preferences.",
      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "food reward, food reinforcement"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do we like sweet foods beyond their taste?",
      "answer": "We like sweet foods not just because they taste good, but because they predict a certain kind of metabolic response. This learned association is part of how our brain perceives and estimates the effects of different foods.",
      "type": "general",
      "topic": "food preference, metabolic response"
    },
    {
      "question": "What resources are available for learning more about food reward systems?",
