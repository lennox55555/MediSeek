      "question": "How does the glycemic index relate to fructose and glucose consumption, and why is it considered controversial?",
      "answer": "The glycemic index is a measure often used to rank foods based on their effect on blood glucose levels. However, Robert Lustig argues that it is misleading because it does not account for the fructose content in foods. For example, a soda with fructose will have a lower glucose rise compared to a bagel with polymerized glucose, leading to a lower glycemic index. Lustig considers the glycemic index to be 'complete and utter BS' and believes it should not be used as a reliable measure.",

    {
      "question": "Why is fiber important for maintaining intestinal health, especially in the context of fructose consumption?",
      "answer": "Fiber is crucial for maintaining the mucin layer, a physical barrier in the intestine that protects against leaky gut. The mucin layer is a polysaccharide that bacteria can consume. If the microbiome is not fed with fiber, it will consume the mucin layer, weakening the intestinal barrier. Fiber helps reinforce this barrier, preventing the harmful effects of fructose, such as the nitration of tight junction proteins and subsequent leaky gut.",

    {
      "question": "Why is vitamin D supplementation not always effective in addressing vitamin D deficiency?",
      "answer": "Vitamin D supplementation may not be effective in addressing deficiency because vitamin D is a pre-pro hormone that needs to be converted into its active form in the body. Inflammatory conditions can cause the conversion of vitamin D into an inactive form that is excreted, rather than being used effectively. Therefore, addressing inflammation is crucial before vitamin D can be effective, and since 93% of Americans are inflamed, supplementation alone is often insufficient.",
