    },
    {
      "question": "What role does the prefrontal cortex play in managing stress responses in children?",
      "answer": "The prefrontal cortex is involved in cognitive flexibility and executive function, which are crucial for regulating emotional responses. It helps provide a 'brake' to the hyperactive amygdala, which is responsible for hypervigilance. If the prefrontal cortex is not functioning well, this regulatory mechanism is impaired, leading to difficulties in managing stress responses.",
