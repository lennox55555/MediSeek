Researchers need to develop new paradigms to quantify social behaviors and understand the neural mechanisms involved.",
      "type": "technical",
      "topic": "neuroscience, social isolation"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the analogy between social interaction and caloric intake help in understanding social needs?",
      "answer": "The analogy suggests that just as the body needs a certain amount of calories to function optimally, individuals require a certain amount and quality of social interaction to maintain social well-being. The quality of interaction, like the quality of calories, is crucial for feeling nourished.",
      "type": "specific",
      "topic": "social interaction, analogy"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why might social media interactions lead to feelings of exclusion or inadequacy?",
