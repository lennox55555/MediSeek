      "topic": "genetics, brain development"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can learning multiple languages as a child make it easier to learn new languages as an adult?",
      "answer": "Yes, learning multiple languages as a child can make it easier to learn new languages as an adult. This is because the brain maintains the ability to produce different sounds, which facilitates the acquisition of additional languages.",

    {
      "question": "How does the process of converting thoughts to written words work in the brain?",
      "answer": "The process involves multiple brain circuits: visual pathways interpret written words, speech pathways silently articulate them, and auditory pathways allow you to 'hear' the speech in your head. Writing then involves translating these signals into motor actions.",
